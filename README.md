botify
======

an IRC bot that can manage a spotify playlist



### Note
You may want to install spotipy from [my fork][1] instead of the default from pip, e.g.:

    pip install --upgrade https://github.com/drsm79/spotipy/archive/master.zip
    
This has a few bugfixes that are yet to make it into a release and support for deleting from a playlist.
